        <!-- Q: 1 -->
        <details>
            <summary><b>How do I find the network information on my ecobee?</b></summary>
            <p>Knowing your thermostat's network information is useful in identifying Wi-Fi issues and when
                troubleshooting with our technical support team.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>On your thermostat, go to the MAIN MENU > ABOUT</li>
                <li> Under About, scroll down and select Wi-Fi to view your thermostat's network information.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>On top of your network information, you can also view your the status of your thermostat's connection to
                your Wi-Fi router as well as to the ecobee.com server. Your Wi-Fi signal strength can also be found here
                – this information is useful in identifying dropped connections as well as Alexa command issues.</p>

        <!-- Q: 2 -->
        <details>
            <summary><b>How do I know my connection is secure?</b></summary>
            <p>ecobee is committed to protecting our customer’s privacy.</p>
            <p>Once the ecobee thermostat has joined the Wi-Fi network, it initiates an encrypted TLS connection to
                ecobee's servers. This TLS connection is authenticated using certificates, and provides privacy and data
                integrity to the underlying communication channel.</p>
            <p>The security model of the thermostat is one in which the device itself always initiates connections to
                ecobee’s servers—no incoming connections from the internet are permitted to the device.</p>
            <p>ecobee products and services use an SSL connection to ensure the highest level of security. The SSL
                protocol is commonly utilized by banks, government agencies, and e-commerce sites to ensure privacy and
                the protection of personal information.</p>
        </details>
        <!-- Q: 3 -->
        <details>
            <summary><b>Can I set up my ecobee without Wi-Fi?</b></summary>
            <p>The short answer is yes.</p>
            <p>Even without a Wi-Fi connection, your ecobee will still function as a traditional thermostat; it will
                engage your equipment as needed and maintain your comfort set points.</p>
            <p>You can simply skip the Wi-Fi Configuration portion when setting up your ecobee, though please be advised
                that skipping this step and never connecting your ecobee to Wi-Fi will not allow you to complete the
                registration process, so you will be unable to create an ecobee account.</p>
            <p>In the event that you require assistance from our Support team, without a registered ecobee account with
                sufficient data, our Support team will be quite limited in the assistance they can provide, so we
                recommend initially connecting to Wi-Fi to at least register your thermostat.</p>
            <p>After you've registered your thermostat, if you choose to proceed without a Wi-Fi connection, you will
                lose some of the ecobee's most useful features such as:</p>

            <h3><b>Remote access through the mobile app and Web Portal</b></h3>
            <p>You will not be able to check the status of your thermostat or make any changes through the mobile app or
                Web Portal.</p>

            <h3><b>Weather</b></h3>
            <p>Your thermostat will not have access to any weather data. If your home has a heat pump system, the ecobee
                relies on weather data to determine if it's safe to run your compressor.</p>

            <h3><b>Home IQ</b></h3>
            <p>To generate Home IQ and System Monitor reports, your thermostat needs to be online and communicating with
                our servers, so you will not receive any efficiency reports or have access to any runtime data.</p>

            <h3><b>HomeKit, Alexa, and other API's</b></h3>
            <p>Since HomeKit (Siri) and Alexa require a stable Wi-Fi connection (as do all other apps such as IFTTT,
                Wink, SmartThings), you will not be able to utilize any of these features.</p>

            <h3><b>Pairing a SmartSensor</b></h3>
            <p>To pair an ecobee SmartSensor to a thermostat, you will need to have the thermostat and your ecobee app
                on the same Wi-Fi connection. To know more about how to pair a SmartSensor to your thermostat, visit our
                general FAQ article.</p>
